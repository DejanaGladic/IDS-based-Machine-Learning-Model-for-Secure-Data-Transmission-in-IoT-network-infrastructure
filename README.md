**IoT network and IDS-based Machine Learning Model**

In this repository are the practical labs for the paper named ***"IDS-based Machine Learning Model specific for
Secure Data Transmission within the frame of IoT network infrastructure"*** which **abstract** is written below.

*Industry 4.0 represents a constant source of data
originating directly from industrial plants. Data is transported
via the communication network from the device that generates
the data to the place of its permanent storage. In the process of
transport, hacker attacks occur on the actors of
communication â€“ the sender, the recipient and the message
itself. In the paper we propose a machine learning model aimed
to analyze network traffic patterns and predict potential
attacks. For the development of the model, a publicly available
dataset is used, which describes normal and problematic
communication within the network of connected IoT devices.
The developed and tested machine learning models are then
compared according to their efficiency and accuracy, and the
algorithm with the best results is accepted as the final result.*

The dataset was found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/supplejade/rt-iot2022real-time-internet-of-things.

The file named *"DataPreprocessing"* refers to the preparation of data for ML learning, while the file named *"MLapplication"* refers to the 
application of selected ML algorithms ***(Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost and Multilayer Perceptron)*** on the cleaned dataset.
